		<h2>Who was Oskar Schindler?</h2>

		<p>Oskar Schindler (1908-1974) was born in Svitavy (Zwittau), Mor√°via, in that time a province of Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Oskar was a german and catholic man. In 1936, he begun to work in the German Office of Foreign Military Intelligence, and in february of 1939 he joined the Nazi Party. A businessman with taste by the good things of life, Schindler didn't look to be someone whose was going to become the savior of so many lives.</p>
		<p>After the german invasion in Polony, he moved to Cracovia. Taking advantage of the german program to arianize the Polonian companies, in november of 1939 he bought a factory of enamelled nails and reopened it with the name of Emalia.
